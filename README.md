## Program Layout
Our program works by first reading in all the server and task data from the provided files. The csv files should be placed in the local directory, and be named Server.csv and Output.csv. It then works iteratively for each subsequent task and assigns it to the server that is the most power efficient/smallest and assigns it to that server. It continues this process until all of the tasks have been completed.

## Program Specifications
Our program runs in Python version 3.12.3. It can be run by calling "python3 driver.py" from the terminal of a device that has Python installed.

## My contribution
